# Bug Fables Randomizer Setup Guide

## Requirements

- Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling (PC)
- [BepInEx 5.4](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) (the `win_x64` download)
- [Archipelago](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases) 0.6.7 or newer
- From the [latest release](https://github.com/Tsukino-uwu/Bug-Fables-Archipelago/releases):
  `bugfables-archipelago.zip`, `bug_fables.apworld` and `bug_fables.yaml`

## Installing

1. Extract BepInEx into your Bug Fables folder, so `winhttp.dll` sits next to `Bug Fables.exe`. Start the game
   once, then close it.
2. Extract `bugfables-archipelago.zip` into your Bug Fables folder. The mod ends up in
   `BepInEx/plugins/BugFablesAP`.
3. Put `bug_fables.apworld` in your Archipelago's `custom_worlds` folder.

## Your options

Edit `bug_fables.yaml` (at least `name`, your slot name) and give it to whoever generates the room.

To play several slots with the same options from one yaml (Archipelago 0.6.8 or newer), add `quantity: 3` at its top,
next to `name`, and give each copy its own name with `{number}`, e.g. `name: Bug{number}`. The host has to allow it
(`allow_quantity` in their `host.yaml`); otherwise generating stops with an error. The
[Advanced YAML Guide](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/advanced_settings/en) has the rest.

## Connecting

On the game's main menu, choose **Archipelago**. The panel has:

- **Address**: `archipelago.gg` by default, which is right for rooms hosted there. A server on your own
  computer needs `ws://` in front: `ws://127.0.0.1`.
- **Port**: the room's port, e.g. `38281`; usually the only thing to change. Pasting a whole
  `archipelago.gg:38281` into Address fills in the port too.
- **Slot**: your slot name in the room.
- **Password**: only if the room has one; leave it empty otherwise.
- **Archipelago**: Enabled keeps randomizer saves in their own folder, apart from your normal saves.
  The main menu shows it as "Archipelago (Enabled)" or "(Disabled)".
- **DeathLink**: Off (the default). On, when your party is defeated in a battle, everyone in the room with DeathLink
  on is too, and their deaths reach you: in a battle, the game's Game Over menu; on the map, a Game Over and back to
  your last save. A death waits for a free moment, never striking in a cutscene or a text box.
- **Achievements**: Off (the default) holds Steam achievements back while the Archipelago mod is enabled, as
  normal saves are kept apart. It only concerns Steam, never Archipelago.
- **Use on normal saves**: Off (the default) keeps normal saves vanilla. On, the Quality of life and Gameplay settings
  also apply with the Archipelago mod disabled. Nothing tied to a seed does.
- Under the rows, a line explaining the highlighted one, and a line showing the connection's state. Cancel
  (X, or B on a gamepad) backs out of the panel.

Select a row and press confirm to type into it: Backspace deletes, **Ctrl+V pastes**, Ctrl+C copies, Enter
keeps it, Escape undoes.

**While the Archipelago mod is enabled and the address, port and slot are filled in, the mod connects on its
own**: when the game starts, when you enable it, and after you change a detail. If the room refuses (a wrong
slot or password), the reason is shown until you change it. If the server can't be reached, or the
connection drops mid-game, it keeps retrying on its own, waiting a bit longer each time. Disabling it
disconnects.

**A randomizer save needs one connection each time the game starts.** Until the mod has logged in once, it
doesn't know the seed, so choosing a file (or a new game) on the file select plays a buzzer and says to connect
first. After that, a dropped connection doesn't stop play: pickups still hold the seed's items, and their
checks are sent when the connection comes back.

## Tracking your seed

[Universal Tracker](https://github.com/FarisTheAncient/Archipelago/releases?q=Tracker) lists which of your locations
are in logic, using this apworld's own rules. Bug Fables needs no yaml for it: it rebuilds your seed from the room,
shuffled doors included, and shows every location your items reach.

1. Download `tracker.apworld` from Universal Tracker's latest release and put it in your Archipelago's
   `custom_worlds` folder, next to `bug_fables.apworld`.
2. Open **Universal Tracker** from the Archipelago Launcher and connect to the room with your slot name.
3. Its tab lists the locations in logic. `/explain` followed by a location's name says what it needs, and
   `/get_logical_path` with a location's name which way leads there.

It uses the `bug_fables.apworld` installed next to it, which must be the release the room was generated with: with
another, it shows an error instead of a list.

## Settings in the game

**Quality of life** and **Gameplay** are two more pages, at the top of the game's own **Settings** (from the pause
menu, and from the main menu), shown while the Archipelago mod is enabled or *Use on normal saves* is on. Each has
**Reset to defaults** and **Disable all** on top, each asking Yes / No first.

Enabling the Archipelago mod (or *Use on normal saves*) also stops a short stutter the game itself has every 5
seconds (it tidies its memory on a timer).

### Quality of life

- **Fast text** (default On): dialogue is instant, and holding skip races through it.
- **Travel** (default Both; or Off, Warp, Map):
  - **Warp**: a pause-menu button back to where the game began, or to the seed's start. In a seed the Warp is
    always there, whatever this says.
  - **Map**: fast travel from the pause menu's map to areas you've visited.
  - Both ask Yes / No first.
- **Skip confirm** (default Off; or Warp, Map, Both): which travel buttons go at once, without the Yes / No.
- **Skip cutscenes** (default On): scenes you don't need to watch are skipped or pass by fast. The new game's intro,
  tutorial battle included, is always skipped with the Archipelago mod enabled: Vi joins and the first check is sent.
- **Item animation** (default All; or Progression, Off): which received items are shown held up.
  - Items replayed on a new file or a reconnect are shown too.
  - Your own finds that the game already shows in its own scene aren't shown twice.
- **Item colors** (default Rarity): how an item's importance is coloured, in the text and the starburst behind it.
  - **Rarity**: like loot in other games: filler green, useful blue, progression purple, trap red.
  - **Archipelago**: as Archipelago's own client colours them.
  - **Off**: the game's own colours.
- **Archipelago icon** (default Other games):
  - **Other games**: another game's item shows the Archipelago icon on the ground, on shelves and when found.
  - **All players**: every item that isn't yours.
  - **Off**: they look like the game's own item there.
- **Item backgrounds** (default On): a check's item, yours included, has a starburst behind it in its Archipelago
  class colour, so you can tell from afar whether it matters. Off keeps it a surprise.
- **Detector** (default On): acts as if the Detector medal were equipped. With the Archipelago mod enabled, the
  Detector (row or medal) also beeps on entering a room that still has a check of any kind, and stays quiet in a
  room with none left.
- **Spy Specs** (default Off): the Spy Specs medal's effects, in halves.
  - **HP**: every enemy's HP shows, spied or not.
  - **Free**: Spy needs no aiming, always works and doesn't use the turn.
  - **Both**: as if the medal were equipped.
- **Uncap FPS** (default Off; experimental): ten pips, like the volume rows.
  - **Off** (the first): the game's own 30 or 60 FPS.
  - **90, 100, 120, 144, 165, 180, 240 or 360**: a cap, with VSync when the number divides your monitor's refresh
    rate or reaches it, otherwise as a limit.
  - **Monitor** (the last): your display's own refresh rate, with VSync, so no tearing. On a 60 Hz display it keeps
    the game's own setting.
  - Motion is drawn smoothly between the game's steps, and the game still plays as it does at 60. Switching it on
    the first time in a session takes a few seconds.

### Gameplay

- **Difficulty** (default Normal):
  - **Normal**: leaves it to the game.
  - **Hard**: plays as if the Hard Mode medal were equipped.
  - **Hardest**: as if the save had the HARDEST code, without writing it into the save.
  - In a seed, boss prize medals are handed out on every setting. On a normal save, as in the game: on Hard from
    Artis, a missed one at the caravan.
- **Enemy scaling** (default Party level):
  - **Party level**: scales every enemy to your level.
  - **Artifacts**: to the artifacts found.
  - **Off**: each enemy keeps its own stats.
  - Difficulty applies on top.
- **Attack boost** (default Off): +1 makes each hit your party lands do 1 more damage.
- **Healing crystals** (default Off): On turns the blue save crystals yellow, so they heal HP and TP as well as
  saving, from the next room on.
- **Auto-save** (default Off): On saves at a new room's door once you can move, at most every 15 seconds, so a
  defeat costs one room.
- **Medal prices** (default full): medals in any shop, a bar in tenths of the price. Full is normal, half is half
  price, empty is free.
- **EXP multiplier** and **Berry multiplier** (default 1x, up to 10x; a bar like the volume rows): EXP from every
  defeated enemy, berries picked up in the world. A battle still gives at most a level's worth, and a check's
  berries are never multiplied.

### The config file

The same settings are saved in `BepInEx/config/bugfables.archipelago.cfg`. One setting is only there: `Compression`
under `[Connection]` (on, as the server asks); turn it off only if connecting keeps failing.
