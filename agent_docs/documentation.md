# How the Bug Fables mod is being made

This is the story of building the **game side** of an [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg) randomizer
for Bug Fables: the mod that runs inside the game, step by step, in the order it happened. It's meant for
anyone curious about the process, or thinking of doing the same for another game.

- **The Archipelago side** (the apworld, seeds, the server, connecting, items and checks) has its own
  guide: [apimplementation.md](apimplementation.md).
- **Facts about how Bug Fables works inside** live in `MEASURED.md`.

## Where it stands

**Done so far:** the mod loads through BepInEx, reloads itself while the game runs, watches the game with
read-only probes, and has a full list of where key items come from. The main menu has an Archipelago panel
for connecting, randomizer saves are kept in their own folder, and finished locations are reported to the
server, and items from the server arrive in the game once each.

**Next:**

1. **Separate randomizer saves:** done. Through a whole session played with the Archipelago mod enabled, the game
   saved only into the `archipelago` folder (last write 05:06), and the normal save files kept their earlier
   times (03:42 and 2023), checked on disk on 2026-09-24. The redirect covers all five places the game touches
   a save file, and normal saves are only reachable with the mod disabled.
2. **Give an item the game's own way**, when the server sends one: works (apimplementation.md, build step 7).
3. **Spot a location being done** (the flag the game sets) and report it: works (apimplementation.md, build
   step 6). The game's own item there is kept out, and the seed's item shown instead (step 9).
4. **Keep the received-item count in the save**, so loading never hands items out twice: works, in a save slot
   the game never uses (`MEASURED.md`, "Free save slots for the mod").
5. **The chat feed**, then the in-game text client (see the design list in step 2).
6. **A Hard Mode on/off setting in the Archipelago panel** (the user, 2026-09-24), deciding Hard Mode instead of
   whether the Hard Mode medal is equipped. Boss prize medals are paid out whatever it says
   (apimplementation.md, "Where it stands").

## Keeping this guide honest

A step-by-step guide is only useful if no step is missing, so the project enforces it: any commit that
changes the mod, the apworld or the dev scripts is refused unless it also updates this file or
[apimplementation.md](apimplementation.md) (or says, explicitly, that nothing about the process changed).
That check is a small git hook, `.githooks/commit-msg` (its neighbour `.githooks/pre-commit` refuses
personal paths and names). Each step below ends with a short *Code:* line naming the files and methods to
read. Each new step also gets a line in the index above,
and "Where it stands" is updated with it.

---

## 1. Check whether the game can be modded at all

Before writing anything, we looked at what the game is made of. Bug Fables is a **Unity game built with
Mono**, which means its code ships as a normal .NET file (`Assembly-CSharp.dll`) that can be turned back
into readable code. That's the easiest case there is. We also checked that nobody had already made a
Bug Fables randomizer.

*How to tell for your own game:* an `Assembly-CSharp.dll` in the game's `_Data/Managed` folder means
Unity with Mono. A `GameAssembly.dll` means Unity with IL2CPP, which is harder.

## 2. Pick the design before the code

A few decisions made first, because they shape everything after:

- **Start small: key items only.** More pools, like medals and crystal berries, come later.
- **"Remote items" only.** Picking something up never gives it to you directly. It tells the server,
  and every item, even your own, comes back from the server. That's simpler to build, a lost save can get
  everything back, and two people can share one slot. The cost: with the server down, nothing arrives.
- **What the player sees** (the user, 2026-09-24):
  - **At your own find** (a pickup, or an NPC handing something over), the game shows **what's really
    there**: a Bug Fables item (yours, or another Bug Fables player's in the same room) with the game's own
    sprite, and any other game's item as the **Archipelago icon**. To know what's there before it's found,
    the mod asks the server first, a "scout", without creating hints (`create_as_hint` 0, see
    `client-requirements.md`).
  - **A small Archipelago chat feed in the bottom-left corner.** It never stops play. It shows the items you
    send and receive, in Archipelago's own wording ("Player1 found their Hammer (Location)", "Player1 sent
    Hammer to Player2 (Location)"), and players connecting and disconnecting. It's **on by default**, with an
    on/off switch in the Archipelago panel. Items arriving from the server show up only there, never as a
    popup. **Later, it becomes a real text client** (the user, 2026-09-24): a key opens a text line over
    the feed, so server commands like `!hint` work in game. The game's controls pause while typing, and the
    server's replies show in the feed.
  - **Item names are coloured the way Archipelago's clients colour them** (`NetUtils.py`): progression plum
    `#AF99EF`, useful slateblue `#6D8BE8`, trap salmon `#FA8072`, filler cyan `#00EEEE`.
- **Read what others already solved.** We read the TEVI randomizer (another Unity mod), Pokémon Emerald's
  apworld, Archipelago's own docs, and notes from an earlier Archipelago project, all for ideas only,
  with each one's licence checked first.

## 3. Read the game's code

We used **ILSpy** to turn the game's `Assembly-CSharp.dll` back into C# source, kept on our own machine
and never shared. Reading it answered the first big question: *how does this game hand out items?*
The answer was a small set of places every item goes through, which is exactly where a randomizer
needs to hook in.

## 4. Get a mod loader running

Unity games don't load mods by themselves, so we installed **BepInEx 5**, the usual mod loader for
Unity games. One launch of the game confirmed it worked, and showed its log file.

*Code: `mod/BugFablesAP/Plugin.cs` (`Plugin`, a BepInEx plugin: `Awake` sets everything up, `Tick` runs
every frame); the project file is `BugFablesAP.csproj`.*

## 5. Make changes load without restarting the game

Restarting the game for every change is slow, so before any real feature we set up **hot reload**:
change the mod, and it swaps itself into the running game in a second or two.

This took some detective work. The standard tool for it (ScriptEngine) relies on a feature this game's
runtime doesn't have, and it failed silently. Turning on more logging showed the real error. The fix was
small: the mod checks its own file once a second and asks for a reload when it changes.

**Lesson:** when something silently does nothing, make the invisible errors visible before guessing.

**Build, then copy.** `dev-scripts/stage-dev.ps1` builds the mod and stages it inside the repo, in `stage/`,
laid out like the game folder. Copying it into the game is a separate step (the user, 2026-09-24): the build
never writes to the game install. After each build, copy
`stage/every-build/BepInEx` onto the game folder, and the running game reloads it. Copy `stage/setup/BepInEx`
(the client libraries and ScriptEngine's config) once, with the game closed, and again only when the script
says the libraries changed.

**The copy keeps a backup.** `dev-scripts/copy-dev.ps1` does that copy, and can switch Debug settings in the
mod's config in the same run. Before replacing anything it copies the old file to `stage/backup/`, and
`-Restore` puts it back. It exists because an agent's copy into the game was refused twice as irreversible
(2026-09-24): a copy that can be undone is the safe kind.

*Code: `DevReload.cs` (`TryCreate`, `Tick`); `dev-scripts/stage-dev.ps1`, `dev-scripts/copy-dev.ps1`.*

## 6. Watch the game while you play ("probing")

Reading code tells you what *can* happen. Watching the game tells you what *does*. We added small,
read-only **probes** to the mod. They never change the game, and they write to a log:

- one logs every **key item** that arrives, and every **flag** the game sets (flags are how the game
  remembers what you've done);
- one logs every **item script** the game runs when it hands something out.

Then the user simply played, and told us when they found something. Each find showed which flag the game
sets for it. That flag is how the randomizer will recognise "this spot is done". It also sorted pickups
into kinds: ones that come back after you leave an area can't be randomizer locations, and one-time ones
can.

**Lesson:** the live log caught a mistake in our reading of the code (every item number was off by one),
which is why things are measured, not just read.

When something left no trace in the log at all, we compared two of the user's saves instead: one from before
and one from after. The mod decodes both inside the game, using the game's own routine (so the game's key
never leaves it), and lists which values changed. It's read-only and never writes a save.

*Code: `GrantProbe.cs` (key items and flags), `TextProbe.cs` (item scripts, read as the game's
`MainManager.SetText` runs them), `SaveDiff.cs` (the two-save comparison). All off by default, switched on
in the Debug section of the config.*

## 7. List everything, without playing everything

Playing the whole game to find every item would take days, so we also asked the running game directly:
a one-off dump loaded every map's dialogue data and kept only the item and flag commands. Together with
the code, that gave a full list of where key items come from, raw material for the apworld.

*Code: `ScriptDump.cs` (`TryRun`).*

**A second dump for what lies on the ground, and what gates it.** Items lying in the world aren't in any
dialogue. They are *entities*, rows in each map's entity table, which the game parses in
`MapControl.CreateEntities`. Each row also carries two lists of story flags: those the entity needs before it
appears (`requires`) and those that hide it (`limit`). Every pickup, door and blocker is gated by those two
lists, so the dump gives both what each pickup is and much of what the logic has to know about it. The
parser puts every count at a fixed position followed by a fixed-size block, so the dump reads fields at the
same positions the parser does. A second file names every item and medal id. Both files stay in the BepInEx
folder; the facts drawn from them go into `MEASURED.md`.

*Code: `EntityDump.cs` (`TryRun`), switched on by `EntityDump` in the config's Debug section.*

## 8. An Archipelago menu inside the game

Players need to type a room address, a slot name and maybe a password, so the mod adds **"Archipelago"** to the
game's main menu. It opens a panel drawn with the game's own box and font, so it looks like part of the game,
but it takes real typing: the game itself never reads typed text (its name screen is a letter grid), so the
mod reads the keyboard itself. Backspace, Ctrl+V to paste and Ctrl+C to copy all work. The same panel switches
**the Archipelago mod** (enabled or disabled), which keeps randomizer saves in their own folder so normal saves are never touched.

Several things went wrong on the way, each found on screen by the user:

- **A fourth menu line landed on top of the credits.** Fixed by spacing the four lines a little tighter and
  moving the game's cursor to match.
- **The panel was drawn behind the logo**, with the main menu showing through it. Fixed by drawing it in front
  and hiding the title screen while it's open, as the game does for its own file select.
- **Backing out crashed the menu.** The game rebuilds its main menu every time you return to it, and its own
  code only knows three entries; our extra fourth one made it read past the end of its list. Fixed by handing
  the game back its three entries before it rebuilds, and adding ours again afterwards.

- **The game's own Settings screen broke**: its leaf cursor no longer lined up. The title screen keeps running
  underneath Settings, and our fix for the main menu's spacing kept moving whatever cursor was active, which
  there was the Settings one. Fixed by only touching the cursor while the main menu itself is showing.
- **Backing out left the leaf on "Archipelago"**, while backing out of Start Game or Settings puts it on
  Start Game (the user noticed). The game rebuilds its menu on the way back, and the rebuild resets the
  cursor to the top. Our panel doesn't rebuild the menu, so it now resets the cursor itself, as the user chose
  to match the game.
- **The leaf sat far left of the labels**, next to the game's Settings screen. The first two nudges were
  measured from single cropped screenshots and went the wrong way ("Address" ended up on the vine border). What
  worked was the user's **side-by-side screenshots** of both screens: Settings starts its labels ~88 px in from
  the vine, with the leaf's tip right before them, so the labels moved to that distance with the leaf beside them.
  **Lesson:** compare against the real thing in one view, not against a number read off another picture.
- **The leaf didn't wiggle** like the game's (the user noticed once it sat beside its label). The game gives its
  menu cursor a `SpriteBounce` component when it creates it; the panel's leaf now gets the same one.
- **No sound opening or closing the panel**, where Start Game and Settings have one (the user noticed). The
  game plays "Confirm" for every main-menu choice before acting on it, and our entry takes the press first,
  so it skipped the sound. The mod now plays the same "Confirm" on opening, and "Cancel" when backing out with
  the cancel button, the sound the game uses leaving the file select. Choosing the panel's "Back" line plays
  "Confirm", like any other menu choice.

**Lesson:** when adding to a game's own screen, find every time the game rebuilds that screen, and everything
else that keeps running while another screen is on top of it.

The user then asked for it to feel like the game's settings screen, so the mod rebuilds that screen's look
from the game's own pieces, read from how the pause menu builds it: the same orange box, the controls box
above it with the game's button hints, the game's leaf cursor, labels on the left and values on the right, and
arrows around the On/Off value.

*Code: `MenuToggle.cs` (the menu entry: `BeforeSetMenuText` and `AfterSetMenuText` around the game's rebuild,
`AfterUpdate` for the cursor, `SetMode` for the switch); `ApMenu.cs` (the panel: `Build`, `Redraw`,
`Navigate`, `TypeInto` for typing, `Close`); `SaveRedirect.cs` (the separate save folder, patching the
game's five save-file functions in `InputIO`).*

## 9. Keep the game's own item, show the seed's

With items remote only, finding a location must not give you the game's item there. The game still has to
mark the location done, though, because that flag is how the check gets sent. So the mod leaves the scene
alone and changes just two things inside it: **the item never reaches your inventory, and the item-get
shows what the seed actually put there.**

- **Where to change it:** every item the game hands out in dialogue goes through one command, `giveitem`,
  inside one very long routine. Reading its compiled code (the IL, the instructions the game really runs)
  showed a fixed order: pick the item's sprite, write its name, add it to the inventory, play the item sound.
  The mod rewrites just those calls with a Harmony *transpiler*. It swaps the sprite for the real item's,
  skips the inventory add, and puts the real name in the "You got" box.
- **Knowing it's a location:** the apworld records, for each location, the `giveitem` that hands out its
  vanilla item (map, kind, item number), and sends that in `slot_data`. Only an exact match is swapped;
  every other item the game gives is left alone.
- **Knowing what's there:** at each login the mod asks the server what's at its locations (a "scout", without
  creating hints) and keeps the answer.
- **Safety:** before changing anything, the patch checks the shape it expects. It needs exactly one sprite
  call, one description-box call before it, one inventory add for items and one for medals between the
  sprite and the item sound, and one read of the first-medal flag after the sound. If the game's code ever
  differs, it installs nothing and says so in the log, instead of patching the wrong spot. (The name
  and the starburst aren't among the rewritten calls: the name is swapped in the text the box reads, and the
  starburst is found on screen and recoloured.)

**Lesson:** reading the game's source told us *what* happens; reading its compiled code told us *where* it
can safely be changed. A misread from earlier also surfaced here: the numbers after an item in `giveitem`
had been taken as "who holds it up", and are really "which line of dialogue comes next".

**Tested by the user (2026-09-24):** a seed with the Explorer Permit placed on Artis's medal (Archipelago's
item plando). Talking to Artis showed "You got the Explorer Permit!" with the permit's sprite, and on screen
no medal was added and no second permit appeared. Three leftovers of the medal were visible, so the patch
grew to cover them: **the description box** (the game opens it just before the sprite, now with the real
item's description, or none for another game's item), **the starburst colour** behind the sprite (now the
real item's kind, or its Archipelago colour for another game's item), and **the first-medal tutorial** that
followed. That one is skipped, because no medal was given, and flag 31 stays unset for the real first medal.
The user then confirmed all three on screen with the G-Bug Ranger Plushie placed there instead: its sprite,
its description and the key-item colour, with no tutorial.

*Code: `ItemSwap.cs` (`Enable` finds the routine, `Transpile` rewrites it; `Decide`, `DescWindow`,
`Recolour` and `FirstMedalSeen` do the swapping); the scout is `ApConnection.Scout`.*
